	<h1>Street Workout</h1>
	
	<h3><a name = "Mean"> What this means?</a></h3>
		<p>
		Street workout is a physical activity performed mostly in outdoor parks or public facilities. It originated in Ancient Greece, but became a popular movement in Russia, Eastern Europe,[1] and the United States, especially in New York City and Baltimore's urban neighborhoods.[2] It has now spread all over the world. It is a combination of athletics, calisthenics, and sports.[3] Street workout is a modern name for bodyweight workouts in outdoor parks. Street workout teams and organized competitions exist.

		A typical street workout routine often consists of physical exercises such as pull-ups, chin-ups, push-ups, dips, muscle-ups, sit-ups and squats. Street workout also involves some static (isometric) holds such as the human flag, front lever, back lever and planche.[4]

		Street workout can be divided in two branches, one being strength training and the other dynamics. Strength training includes the isometric holds like: planche, front lever, back lever, etc. Also, strength training includes single arm pull ups, hefestos, muscle-ups and many others. Dynamics includes movements like 360's and its variations, switchblades, and an incredible variety of tricks developed by the athletes which are connected with other moves in order to create routines or sets
